            <p> I'm a third year Computer Engineering major with a minor in Chinese Studies. 
            </p>
            <p>I would say I lucked out picking the major I have. I took an introductory programming course 
                in high school and really enjoyed that, but also really enjoyed the various physics courses
                 I took as well. I took a bit of a gander on the major I chose and I couldn't be happier. 
                 It has allowed me to diversify my knowledge toolkit and let me explore different career paths.
            </p>
            <p> On campus I am involved as a tutor for the Electrical Engineering Department, and as a Campus 
                Ambassador (campus tour guide). I am currently looking to get involved in research to explore 
                academia as a potential career path.
            </p>
            <p> I know I have a lot to learn, but as of now, my favorite programming languages are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
            </ol>
            <p> Honestly, I am not too sure which niche of Computer Science I want to go into, but hey, I guess thatâ€™s the point of college. </p>
            <p> This is my to-do list as it stands now: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Finish out winter quarter strong</li>
                <li>Attend graduate school</li>
                <li>Fill in intermediate list items</li>
            </ul>
            To wrap the <b> professional </b> section up, I will leave you with my <i>favorite block of code</i>.
